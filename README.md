# Liri-Node-App

This app is uses NPM node, Twitter API, Spotify API, and the OMDB API. When node liri.js is ran in the terminal/cmdline the user is asked 
to pick one of four commands: get my latest tweet, info on a desire movie, info on a desired song, and a random-ish command. The main take
is the usefulness of using APIs to retrieve JSON formatted data.
